## ✏️ Prompt - 01

**📎 Context:** First I created a new project and attached the Business Document and Grading Sheet for Mod 11.
I have Installed Java (v17) and verified the installation. I have also created a new repo and cloned the repo provided by Codeboxx with Java exercises.

inside the repo are some exercises and instructions: Instructions 1. Clone this repository and create your own. 2. Open the project folder in VS Code. - Install the 'Extension Pack for Java' extension - If you're getting an error about needing to install the JDK and you have already installed it, it means that you need to set your environment variables properly. 3. Complete each exercise in the given order. Each time you finish an exercise, perform a commit with a relevant commit description. The exercises will ask you to: - Create new classes. Each class is in its own file (see Person.java) - Create methods and attributes - Use inheritance - Manipulate data and show results with System.out.println() -- The (Main) part of each exercises needs to be done in the main method of the Main class. # Exercise 1: Creating a Bank Account 1. Create a BankAccount class with attributes: accountNumber (String) and balance (double). 2. Implement a constructor to initialize the account details. 3. Add a deposit(double amount) method to increase the balance. 4. Add a withdraw(double amount) method to decrease the balance. Ensure the withdrawal amount is less than the balance. 5. (Main) Create an instance of BankAccount and demonstrate deposit and withdrawal operations. The file called Main.java has the following: // Exercise 1: Creating a Bank Account // Create a BankAccount instance // Perform deposit and withdrawal operations. I will create a new code called BankAccount.java, what do I do next?

## 🤖 Response - 01
Great—nice setup so far. After you add BankAccount.java, do these steps:

1) Implement the class (encapsulation + basic validation)

Create it in the same folder/package as Main.java (use the same package line if your project has one).
java code (...)

2) Use it from Main.java

Open Main.java and, inside the main method, create an instance and call the methods:
java code (...)

3) Run it

VS Code (Java Extension Pack):

Press ▶️ “Run” on Main.java, or use Run > Start Debugging.

4) Commit your work

Use clear, atomic commits:

feat(oop): add BankAccount class with deposit/withdraw

chore(main): demo BankAccount operations in Main
